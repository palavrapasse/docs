# api

This file contains the specification of the APIs provided by the platform's web services.

---

The Web Services that compose the platform will provide an API not backed by REST architectural style or the SOAP protocol.

We use the OpenAPI Specification (Version 3.0.3) to describe and document all Web APIs:

- [santos](src/schemas/api/santos.yaml)
- [query](src/schemas/api/query.yaml)
